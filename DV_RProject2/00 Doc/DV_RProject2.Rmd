###The data that we are going to present is called "Employee Salaries In 2014".

###This is Summary and Subset of the data
```{r}
require("jsonlite")
require("RCurl")
# Change the USER and PASS below to be your UTEid
df <- data.frame(fromJSON(getURL(URLencode('129.152.144.84:5001/rest/native/?query="select * from employee_salaries_20142"'),httpheader=c(DB='jdbc:oracle:thin:@129.152.144.84:1521/PDBF15DV.usuniversi01134.oraclecloud.internal', USER='cs329e_bth679', PASS='orcl_bth679', MODE='native_mode', MODEL='model', returnDimensions = 'False', returnFor = 'JSON'), verbose = TRUE), ))

summary(df)
head(df)
```

###Below here are 3 data wrangling sets that we found very interesting

###This is the first set
```{r}
df %>% select(CURRENT_ANNUAL_SALARY, DEPARTMENT, POSITION_TITLE) %>% filter(CURRENT_ANNUAL_SALARY >= 80000, DEPARTMENT %in% c("POL", "DOT", "DTS", "HHS", "FRS")) %>% ggplot(aes(x = POSITION_TITLE, y = CURRENT_ANNUAL_SALARY, color = DEPARTMENT)) + geom_point()
```

###This is the second set
```{r}
df %>% select(CURRENT_ANNUAL_SALARY, DEPARTMENT, GENDER) %>% group_by(GENDER) %>% filter(DEPARTMENT %in% c("POL","HHS")) %>% ggplot(aes(x = DEPARTMENT, y = CURRENT_ANNUAL_SALARY, color = GENDER)) + geom_point()
```
